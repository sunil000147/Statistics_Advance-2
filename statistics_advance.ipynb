    "where X is the random variable, x is a specific value of X, and P(X = x) represents the probability that X takes on the value x.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "Let's consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of rolling the die. The PMF for X would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF(1) = P(X = 1) = 1/6\n",

    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "The PDF is used for continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a certain range. It represents the likelihood of the random variable falling within a specific range of values.

    "The PDF describes the shape of the distribution, indicating the likelihood of obtaining a particular value or falling within a specific range of values. To calculate the probability of X falling within a range [a, b], you would integrate the PDF from a to b:\n",

    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a widely used probability distribution that often serves as a model for various real-world phenomena. Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:\n",

    "1. Height: The distribution of adult human heights tends to follow a normal distribution, with most people falling around the mean height and fewer people at the extremes (very tall or very short).\n",

    "3. Measurement Errors: In many scientific and engineering applications, measurement errors are assumed to follow a normal distribution. This assumption allows for statistical analysis and estimation of uncertainty in the measurements.\n",

    "4. Financial Markets: The returns on stocks, indices, and other financial instruments are often assumed to be normally distributed, which is a fundamental assumption in many financial models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters of the normal distribution are the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). These parameters determine the shape of the distribution as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean (μ): The mean of the normal distribution represents the central tendency or average value. It determines the location of the peak of the distribution. Shifting the mean to the left or right will move the entire distribution along the horizontal axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation of the normal distribution quantifies the spread or dispersion of the data points around the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closely packed around the mean, resulting in a narrower and taller bell-shaped curve.

    "Real-life examples of normal distribution include:\n",

    "Heights: When we measure the heights of a large group of adults, the distribution tends to follow a normal distribution, with most people close to the average height and fewer people at the extremes (very tall or very short).\n",

    "Exam Scores: In a class, if a test is well-designed and the students' abilities are independent, their scores often approximate a normal distribution. Most students will have scores near the class average, and fewer students will have very high or very low scores.\n",

    "Errors in Measurements: When we make measurements in scientific experiments, there are often small errors due to various factors. These errors typically follow a normal distribution, assuming they are random and unbiased.\n",
